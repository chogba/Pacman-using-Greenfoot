# Pacman-using-Greenfoot
Developed a basic version of Pacman using Greenfoot. This was my first experience with Object Oriented programming concepts, and developing with Greenfoot was very intuitive and a lot of fun.

Introduction:
The classic game of PacMan recreated. The vintage feel is maintained, going back to the old days. Simple, fun and nostalgic, this one is for the 90's kids. :)

Guide to play:
Arrow keys move the PacMan in desired direction one block at a time. Coins award 1 point each and cherries 5 points each. But beware of the ghost, they might eat you up, ending the game. Win after collecting all coins and cherries.
